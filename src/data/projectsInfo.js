    longDescription: "A web application for creating and managing research surveys, built as a team project with 3 other students. This course focused on agile development practices and working with a product owner. I developed the dashboard page, data export functionality, and participant recruitment features, working across both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express with MongoDB). I also handled deployment setup using GitHub Actions and Docker for the backend service. This project taught me full-stack development, REST API design, team collaboration, and DevOps basics.",
